To render a document such as a HTML page, most web browsers use an internal model similar to the DOM. The nodes of every document are organised in a tree structure, called the DOM *tree*, with the topmost node named as "Document object". When an HTML page is rendered in browsers, the browser downloads the HTML into local memory and automatically parses it to display the page on screen.
