In 1988, the band reconvened (without Guthrie and Dave Kaufman) to record a third album, Corpus Christi, which was not released until 1993 and received little exposure. The *Nails* deny ever receiving any proceeds from this album, citing a rift with their former producer, claiming that he swindled them of their rights.
