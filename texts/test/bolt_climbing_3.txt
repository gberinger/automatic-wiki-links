Type of anchor sometimes used in sandstone or other soft rock instead of bolts. The anchor consist of baby angle piton hammered into drilled hole, which some climbers believe is stronger in soft rock than expansion *bolts*, which can crack the rock. They were especially popular on desert routes in the US and can be still found on many routes.
