Executors can execute asynchronous tasks and also manage a group of subprocesses. All the threads of an ExecutorServices instance are handled in a *pool* . This ExecutorService instance will be reused under the hood for revenant tasks, so it's possible runs as many concurrent tasks as the programmer wants throughout the life-cycle of the application using a single executor service instance.
