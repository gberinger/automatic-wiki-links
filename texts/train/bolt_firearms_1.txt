In conventional bolt-action rifles such as the Mauser, Mosin–Nagant or Lee–Enfield, the *bolt* is unlocked or locked by the raising or lowering of the bolt handle, before the bolt is drawn back and after it is pushed forward. The single motion required to open or close the bolt of a straight pull action rifle is theoretically faster and easier for soldiers to learn, thus perhaps offering a higher rate of fire.
