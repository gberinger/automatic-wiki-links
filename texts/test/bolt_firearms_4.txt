Historically, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger. Modern rifles are commonly classified as single shot, *bolt* action, semi-automatic, or automatic. Single shot, bolt action, and semi-automatic rifles are limited by their designs to fire a single shot for each trigger pull.
