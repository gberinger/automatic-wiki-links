Both Mood Swing and Dangerous Dreams made the Billboard top 200 album chart and were critically acclaimed. But after the release of Dangerous Dreams The *Nails* left RCA. RCA did not release either LP on compact disc. "88 Lines About 44 Women" continued to appear on compilations 20 years after its release and was featured in a Mazda television commercial that aired in the late 1990s.
