In synchronised diving events, there is a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark the execution of the other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation. The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the *pool* , and they score the diver which is nearer to them. The 2012 London Olympics saw the first use of eleven judges.
