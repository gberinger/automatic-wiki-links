Like the rest of the UK, the island has an oceanic climate, but is somewhat milder and sunnier, which makes it a holiday destination. It also has a longer growing *season* . Lower Ventnor and the neighbouring Undercliff have a particular microclimate, because of their sheltered position south of the downs.
