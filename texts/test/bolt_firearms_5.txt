A long, needle-shaped firing pin, shot forward by a spring, pierced the cartridge and powder charge to detonate the primer. This needle was housed in a steel cylinder called the *bolt*, which slid forward in the frame of the receiver until it was locked firmly against the base of the cartridge in the chamber. Once the weapon was fired, the soldier released a latch with his thumb, grasped a knob at the end of a handle projecting from the bolt, turned it until locking lugs on the bolt were disengaged from slots in the receiver, and slid the bolt back to open the chamber for reloading.
