Kepler considered as working hypotheses that the Earth was uniformly moving on a circle and that the motion of Mars was periodic and coplanar with the motion of the Earth. Then he used Tycho’s observations to determine the orbit of *Mars*. Tycho’s observations were apparent positions of the planets on the celestial sphere. The resulting datum is a direction (only recently had celestial distances been measured, and only in a few cases).
