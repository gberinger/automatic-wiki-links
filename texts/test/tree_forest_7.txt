The roots of a tree are generally embedded in earth, providing anchorage for the above-ground biomass and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. It should be noted, however, that while ground nutrients are essential to a *tree*'s growth the majority of its biomass comes from carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere (see photosynthesis).
