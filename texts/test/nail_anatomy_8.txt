The nail grows from a deep groove in the dermis of the skin. All *nail* growth occurs at the nail’s base, where the specialized cells that make up the nail’s plate are produced; these cells are pushed forward as new cells form behind them. The nail plate is also attached to the underlying, richly vascularized nail bed, which supplies the plate with necessary nutrients.
