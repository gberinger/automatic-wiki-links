Women in many societies attempt to enhance their secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and waist to hip ratio as well as their appearance of health and youthfulness, through figure enhancing garments and various forms of makeup (e.g., lipstick, *nail* polish, rouge, hair coloration). Men may exaggerate, or create, their V-shaped torso with shoulder padded garments or manipulate secondary sexual characteristics, such as the beard, in order to enhance appearance.
