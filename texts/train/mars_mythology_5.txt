Republican Rome's religious practises harked back to Rome's quasi-mythical history. Romulus, a son of *Mars*, founded Rome after Jupiter granted him favourable bird-signs regarding the site. Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome, had established Rome's basic religious and political institutions after direct instructions from the gods, given through augury, dreams and oracle.
