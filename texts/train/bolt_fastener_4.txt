Bolt, mechanical fastener that is usually used with a nut for connecting two or more parts. A *bolted* joint can be readily disassembled and reassembled; for this reason bolts or screw fasteners are used to a greater extent than any other type of mechanical fastener and have played an important part in the development of mass-produced articles and steel structures.
