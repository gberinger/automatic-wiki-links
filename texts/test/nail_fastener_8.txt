There are many different types of *nails*, the types depending on the material that they are driven into and the degree of holding power that they must have. Two basic classes of nails are common nails and finishing nails (see Figure). The most widely used of all nails, the common nail has a large, flat head that is driven in so that it is flush with the material’s surface. A finishing nail has a smaller, narrower head that is driven in below the material’s surface with a special tool called a nail set, or punch; the small depression remaining is filled in with putty.
