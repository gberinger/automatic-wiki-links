In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snowâ€“temperature feedback. However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of *seasons* , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting.
