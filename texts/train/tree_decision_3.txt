Each element of the domain of the classification is called a class. A decision tree or a classification tree is a *tree* in which each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input feature. The arcs coming from a node labeled with an input feature are labeled with each of the possible values of the target or output feature or the arc leads to a subordinate decision node on a different input feature.
