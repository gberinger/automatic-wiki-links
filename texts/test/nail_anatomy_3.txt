the harder β-keratins are found only in the sauropsids, that is all living reptiles and birds. They are found in the *nails*, scales, and claws of reptiles, some reptile shells (Testudines, such as tortoise, turtle, terrapin), and in the feathers, beaks, and claws of birds. (These keratins are formed primarily in beta sheets. However, beta sheets are also found in α-keratins.)
