As anyone who has ever attended high school knows, human females emphasize their secondary sexual characteristics, incorporate add-on ornaments (e.g., jewelry, flattering clothing, perfumes, hair and *nail* coloration), and often engage in vigorous competition over males. Human males also engage in ornamentation via jewelry, clothing, manipulation of secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair, and compete through displays of resources, such as fancy cars.
