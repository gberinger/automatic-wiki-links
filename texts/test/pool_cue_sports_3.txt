American snooker, a variant dating to 1925, usually played on a 10 ft × 5 ft (3.0 m × 1.5 m) table with 2 1⁄8 in (54 mm) balls, and a simpler rule set influenced by *pool* . (Despite its name, the strictly amateur American snooker is not governed or recognised by the United States Snooker Association, but by the Billiard Congress of America.)
