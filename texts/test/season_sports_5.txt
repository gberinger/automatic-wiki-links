he first win in club history would come on October 18 when the troops beat the visiting Sudbury Wolves 5-4. The first *season* on the ice didn't go so well however as the Battalion finished the season with only 8 wins, 57 losses, and 3 ties for last in the Western Conference and 19th in the league ahead of only the Mississauga Ice Dogs.
