Traditional climbing (more casually known as Trad climbing) is a form of climbing without fixed anchors and *bolts*. Climbers place removable protection such as camming devices, nuts, and other passive and active protection that holds the rope to the rock (via the use of carabiners and webbing/slings) in the event of a fall and/or when weighted by a climber.
