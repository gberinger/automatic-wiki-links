Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.
Just before plunging into the *pool* , swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting. Squatting helps in enhancing a swimmerâ€™s start by warming up the thigh muscles.
