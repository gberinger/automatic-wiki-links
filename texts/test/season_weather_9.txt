Autumn, also known as fall in American English and sometimes in Canadian English, is one of the four temperate *seasons* . Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down considerably.
