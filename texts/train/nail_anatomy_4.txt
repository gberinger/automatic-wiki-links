Cutaneous structures arise from the epidermis and include a variety of features such as hair, feathers, claws and *nails*. During embryogenesis, the epidermis splits into two layers: the periderm (which is lost) and the basal layer. The basal layer is a stem cell layer and through asymmetrical divisions, becomes the source of skin cells throughout life.
